All the useful python I/O utility functions for HDF5 files

## Rationale
Writing this software package aggregator is motivated by the multitude of read/write functions currently existing in the python open source community. The package combines existing mature hdf(5) I/O source code and a few similar isolated functions into a single simple and user-friendly platform to save the labor of writing newer functions of similar capabilities. It's also the basis for building more sophisticate I/O operations.

## Resources
The major resources gathered here include the following packages that covers generic I/O and interconversions between HDF and other key-value-paired file formats, such as **dictionary**, **json**, **mat**.
